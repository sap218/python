'''
An interactive game to exercise what you know about variables, if statements, loops and input/output.
Game: Guess the secret number!
● Initialise a variable to hold a secret number of your choice.
● Prompt the user to input a guess.
● Compare the guess to the secret number. If it's correct, print a congratulations message and stop.
● If it's not correct, then tell the user if the secret is lower or higher than their guess, and prompt them to
guess again. Keep going until they've guessed correctly (while their guess is still wrong).
